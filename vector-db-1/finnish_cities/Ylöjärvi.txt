Ylöjärvi is mainly a rural town. It does not have a clear centre; the Tampere-Vaasa highway (E12) and the Tampere-Seinäjoki railway divide the centre of the municipality into two large distinct parts: the Church Village and Soppeenmäki. The railway, completed in 1971, has no passenger seats in the Ylöjärvi area, so buses provide all public transport. The population has grown in recent years. In 1990 it was about 18,000, in 2011 it was about 30,000, and now it is about 34,000.
The neighbouring municipalities are Hämeenkyrö, Ikaalinen, Kihniö, Nokia, Parkano, Ruovesi, Tampere and Virrat. The municipality of Viljakkala was merged with Ylöjärvi in 2007. The municipality of Kuru was merged with Ylöjärvi in 2009. The coat of arms of Ylöjärvi was designed by Gustaf von Numers and confirmed in 1954.
The results of the 2021 Finnish local elections, resulted in True Finns being the largest political party on the Ylöjärvi council.
